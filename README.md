# Python_post-processing
This repository contains many of the post-processing routines I have developed to analyze my turbulence data

Each routine is used to calculate a different statistical or structural quantity.  At the very least the following packages are necessary:


numpy

scipy

mpi4py

mpi4py-fft

h5py (mpi version)
